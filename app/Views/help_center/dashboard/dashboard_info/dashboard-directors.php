           <p>
             A Director of a company is a person who is responsible for managing the companyâ€™s business activities. In many cases Directors
             are the movers and shaker's and often contribute funds to kick start the business. A company
             must have at least one director. Larger companies and corporations may have many directors, often referred
             to as the 'board of directors'.
           </p>
             <h4>For example:</h4>
             <p>Serina is planning to register a company, she has a partner named Elana, both are directors of the company,
                 as the founder, Serina holds 60% shares in the business and her sister Elana holds 40%</p>
