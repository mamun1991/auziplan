            <p class="mt-1 ps-3 mb-3">
                Setting up a company is Australia involves making a decision about the type of company you want to set up 
                through to registering the company with ASIC and maintaining a company register.
            </p>

            <p class="mt-1 ps-3 mb-3">

                Although this is the opening stage of your business plan, the business name, tagline, 
                logo all add together to help the investor gain a good first impression and understanding of your business and 
                they should lead on and link into the remaining sections of the business plan.

            </p>
            <h5 class="mt-1 ps-3 mb-3">Your Business Name</h5>
            <p class="mt-1 ps-3 mb-3">
                The business name is the first thing a investor will see, and reinforces and communicates the key components of your business, 
                it gives the investor an impression of your business, the more it does this, the easier it will be for the business plan that 
                follows to explain what the business stands for and what it does.

            </p>
            <h5 class="mt-1 ps-3 mb-3">Your Tagline Name</h5>
            <p class="mt-1 ps-3 mb-3">
                The tagline is a short, easily remembered phrase so that people will remember your business. Think Auziplan, “Planing is the key to your succeess”, BMW “The ultimate driving machine” or McDonalds “I’m lovin it”.
                Again the tagline encapsulates everything about the business, it communicates to the investor what kind of business you are, what values the business has, 
                what the product is, how the product provides a solution to a customers problem, and what differentiates the business from the competition. 
                This all hints and helps to reinforce whats to come in the rest of the business plan.

            </p>
            <h5 class="mt-1 ps-3 mb-3" >Your Logo</h5>
            <p class="mt-1 ps-3 mb-3">
                Finally the logo is a visual representation of what the business stands for. The logo helps investors develop a first and lasting impression of the business, 
                to understand what makes your product different from the competition, your competitive advantage, and who your target audience is.
            </p>

            <p class="mt-1 ps-3 mb-3">
                First, seek financial or legal advice to determine if setting up a company is the best means to conduct your business.
                Before you set up a company, you should know the name you want to give to the company, how many and who will be the director(s), shareholders and officeholders, 
                how many shares each shareholder will hold etc.
            </p>
