        <p>A company's balance sheet, also known as a "statement of financial position," reveals the firm's assets, liabilities and owners' equity (net worth). 
            The balance sheet, together with the income statement and cash flow statement, make up the cornerstone of any company's financial statements.

        If you are a shareholder of a company or a potential investor, it is important to understand how the balance sheet is structured, how to analyze it and how to read it.

        <p>
            A debtor is a company or individual who owes money. If the debt is in the form of a loan from a financial institution, the debtor is referred to as a borrower, 
            and if the debt is in the form of securities – such as bonds – the debtor is referred to as an issuer. 
            Legally, someone who files a voluntary petition to declare bankruptcy is also considered a debtor.
