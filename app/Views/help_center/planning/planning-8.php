	Who are you?, Who owns the company, how did you get here?, what brought you down this path?, why should your target market, or investors believe what youâ€™re telling them?, 
	what experience or qualifications do you or you partners have in this business field. Contrary to what people may think, your personal story is important and relevant to your Business Plan. 
	Don't make the mistake of presenting your business as just another boring organization.Instead, let everyone see the real you and let your personality stand out from the crowd.
