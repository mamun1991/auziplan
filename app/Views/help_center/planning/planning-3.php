      Brainstorming is about sitting down with your family, friends or partners to discuss your business ideas and concepts, 
      whats your purpose? Whats your cause? what are your beliefs?, how do you intend to grow your business as well as establishing ideas for financing. 
      The goal of your Business Plan is to register a unique business name, and have a clear picture of what your company does, 
      and what steps you will undertake to reach your goals and objectives.
